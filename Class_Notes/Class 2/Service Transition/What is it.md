The Service Transition lifecycle phase ensures that service changes – be they new, modified,  
or retired services – are ready.  
You’ll have noticed by now that ITIL is generally focused on some basic tenets which will  
repeat themselves in the language of these chapters. Namely: documented observation,  
planning, responsiveness to stimuli, and big-picture awareness. The philosophy is to have a  
system in place that is repeatable, scalable, and understood by the roles responsible for  
carrying them out.  
Service Transition is primarily concerned with ensuring that service changes are “ready for  
prime time” and can sometimes be thought of as a kind of filter for these changes, where  
they are observed for errors, redundancy, or unexpected outcomes.  
Service Transition is about how modifications to the operational environment should be  
managed, planned, and coordinated.
