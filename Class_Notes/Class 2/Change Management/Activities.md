Create and Record Request For Change (RFC)  
The change initiator raises and creates an RFC  
RFC Review  
Change Management assesses the RFC for acceptability and ensures that it includes all  
necessary information, filtering out requests for return to the initiator as needed.  
Assess and Evaluate The Change  
So long as the RFC is sufficient, the change will be submitted for formal evaluation by the  
Change Manager and the CAB, based on previously established criteria and/or by the  
appropriate change authority (see upcoming slide: The 7 R’s of Change Management)  
Schedule and Authorize Change Build and Test  
Authorize and enact detailed change and release planning prior to developing new build



Authorize Change Deployment  
All aspects of the change at this point should be tested and reviewed by the relevant change  
authority.  
Coordinate Change Deployment  
Change Management is responsible for ensuring that changes are deployed as scheduled,  
which is done by coordinating with the departments doing the work itself. In addition, this sub-  
process should prepare remediation changes in advance so that, if errors occur after  
deployment, these procedures can be quickly applied to minimize impact on service quality.  
NOTE: Some significant changes may have multiple deployment stages.  
Review and Close Change Record  
Once the change has been successfully applied, a thorough period of evaluation and post-  
implementation review is conducted, during which the quality of the change is determined,  
and stakeholder satisfaction and a variety of other approval targets are assessed.  
Of crucial importance during this process are the cataloging of lessons learned in response to  
evaluation, as these will improve change management standards for the organization’s future.
