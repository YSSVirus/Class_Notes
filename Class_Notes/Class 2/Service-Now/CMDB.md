Configuration Management Database (CMDB)

● ServiceNow provides a single record system for IT, and that is the configuration management
database (CMDB).
● A CMDB is a database that contains all relevant information about the components of the
information system used in an organization's IT services and the relationships between those
components. A CMDB provides an organized view of data and a means of examining that data from
any desired perspective. Within this context, components of an information system are referred to
as configuration items (CIs). A CI can be any conceivable IT component, including software, hardware,
documentation, and personnel, as well as any combination of them.
● Technical services must be established in the CMDB so clients can get help and support staff can
manage Incidents and change requests.
