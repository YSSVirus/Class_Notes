IT service continuity management (ITSCM) is  
the process responsible for managing risks that  
could seriously affect IT services.

ITSCM ensures that the IT service provider  
can always provide minimum agreed service  
levels by reducing the risk to an acceptable  
level and planning for the recovery of IT  
services.  
Service continuity is an essential part of the  
warranty of a service. If a serviceâ€™s continuity  
cannot be maintained then the business will  
not experience the value that has been  
promised.
