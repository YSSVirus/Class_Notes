To provide the strategic direction for security activities and  
ensure its objectives are achieved, with a special reliance on  
preventing information security breaches.  
ITIL makes a point that the term information being used in this  
respect is general, and includes data stores, databases, and  
metadata, not client/customer information alone.  
This main process is critical when regarding the warranty of a  
service – and thereby is perceived value. Security objectives can  
be considered met when:  
-Information confidentiality is kept  
-Information integrity is maintained  
-Information is available when required  
-Business transactions and information exchange  
between enterprises can be trusted


Information security management (ISM)  
is the process responsible for ensuring that  
the confidentiality, integrity and availability of  
an organization’s assets and information  
match the needs of the business.  
The purpose of ISM is to align IT security with  
business security and ensure that the  
confidentiality, integrity and availability of the  
organization’s assets, information, data and IT  
services always matches the agreed needs of the  
business.
