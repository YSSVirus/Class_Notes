PURPOSE  
Produce and maintain a Service Catalog, which will contain  
details of all services currently operation, as well as newly  
designed services. This process can be seen as a resource that  
is utilized throughout the Service Design phase. There are no  
sub-processes within this process.  
OUTPUT  
Updated RFCs, Service Portfolio updates, documenting how  
services are defined, and the Service Catalog.  
The Service Catalog is a database or document with  
information about all operational and deployable/incoming  
services, and a component of the Service Portfolio. This is the  
only part of the Service Portfolio made available to  
customers/clients and is utilized as a selling resource.
