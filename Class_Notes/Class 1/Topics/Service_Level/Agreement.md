A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a level  
of assurance or warranty with regard to the  
level of quality delivered by the service  
The success of SLM is tied closely with the  
quality of the service portfolio and service  
catalog


SLAs are  
supported by appropriate  
OLAs
an OLA is an agreement between IT service provider and another part of the same organzitaion that assists with the provision of services


SLA Framework  
Serviced Based SLA: One SLA covers one service,  
for all the customers of that service  
Customer Based SLA: One SLA with an individual  
customer group, covering all the services they  
use.  
Corporate Level SLA: One SLA covering core  
services for all customers. Often authorized by the  
COO.  
Multi-Level SLA: A multi- level SLA structure that can  
include: Service Based, Customer Based and Corporate  
based SLAs.


An SLA definition is used to create and progress SLAs,  
enabling you to use an SLA system for your organization's  
tasks.  
ServiceNow manages Service Level Targets as SLAs.  
An SLA definition record defines the timings, conditions, workflows, and other information required to create and  
progress task SLAs.  
For example, the default Priority 1 resolution (8 hour) SLA Definition defines the Task SLAs to attach to incidents with a  
P1 - Critical priority, specifies appropriate conditions for those Task SLAs, and uses the default SLA workflow to create  
events such as to send a notification, when an incident's Task SLA reaches 50% of its allotted time.
