Continual Service Improvement – from hereon in we will simply say CSI for brevity’s sake – is always  
positioned on the outer ring of an ITIL hub-and-spoke wheel diagram. Thus, it should be understood that  
CSI is a perpetual presence, communicative with the other phases of the service lifecycle.  
The purpose of the CSI phase is to continually improve the effectiveness and efficiency of IT processes and  
services, in both financial and intangible ways. Monitoring and process evaluation are distinct tenets of this  
phase, and ITIL posits some helpful systems to determine a mindful CSI practice, some of which will be  
introduced on the next few slides.  
The CSI Approach is often the most general and easily communicated diagram for understanding this phase,  
and can be found on the following slide – it’s a great view of the CSI big picture.  
OUTPUT  
Improvement program documentation and the CSI Register are the primary outputs. The CSI register  
records all individual improvements. The CSI register is considered its own service asset, and is managed by  
the SKMS.
