CSI Roles & Ownership  

It should be understood that CSI is a best practice and crucial to a modern IT service provider organization,  
but that its managerial roles are largely responsible for monitoring, analyzing, evaluating, and reporting on  
trends and project-based service improvement activities throughout ITIL...  
...however, they are not in charge of the other four core disciplines.  
In practice, what this means is that accountability and ownership for CSI is relegated to its roles, and those  
roles cannot directly change any other phases, simply advise, inform and recommend. Carrying out  
improvements of specific services are in the domain of the appropriate service owner.  
CSI roles function best when clear and unambiguous accountability is in place for Service Strategy, Service  
Design, Service Transition, and Service Operation.
